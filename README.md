## Rationale

If you are coming from the NodeConf Remote 2020 workshop you are in the right place! The instructors will guide you through this repository to get started!

If you are just discovering this workshop, feel free to try out the exercise and peek at the solutions only when you have something done. In this workshop you are expected to use the [temporal proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) and the [record & tuple proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple/) to complete it.

## Timezone assistant

**Book a meeting across time zones!**

We have some users of NodeConf Plc who want to organise a meeting. They're all in different timezones scattered across the world and could use a way of knowing when they're all available.

Can we make use of Temporal to organise when the best time is for them all to meet?

Maybe your app would gain being a bit more immutable, can you try using Record & Tuple to store state?

## Prerequisite

We recommend Node >= v12.0.0 to be installed. The workshop may work on versions below but we don't promise anything!

## Quick Start

Copy the `starter/` directory and run `npm install`/`yarn` in it, then use `npm start`/`yarn start` to start the app. Open the address printed in your terminal and start coding, the server will live-reload so you don't have to restart it.

## Solutions

**If you are participating, please avoid peeking at the solutions unless an instructor directs you to them.**

Solutions are in the `solutions/` directory and you'll have to replace `src/index.js` from the starter with the one in the solution to try it.
